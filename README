CONFIGURATION
===========================================

rake gems:install
rake gems:install RAILS_ENV=test
rake db:migrate

You're good to go!

An admin user (admin / admin) is created for you to start with...


HOPTOAD------------------------------------

For Hoptoad you should have something like this in config/initializers/hoptoad.rb.

  HoptoadNotifier.configure do |config|
    config.api_key = '1234567890abcdef'
  end

Use rake hoptoad:test to test that your api key is set-up correctly.  If everything is configured properly, that task will send a notice to hoptoad which will be visible immediately.


TODO
===========================================
* add Capistrano recipes
* fully HAMLfy remaining ERBs (e.g. the auto-generated Clearance views)
